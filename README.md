Protein Whisper — Interactive Proteome Conformation Dynamics Explorer

Protein Whisper is an interactive Streamlit application for visualizing protein conformational changes, solubility, and total abundance using TMT-LiP–MS–based structural proteomics.
It integrates:

  AlphaFold structural models
  
  Peptide-level conformation metrics
  
  Protein-level abundance (soluble / pellet / total)
  
  Interactive 3D visualization with py3Dmol
  
  Volcano plots for conformation changes
  
  Dynamic peptide highlighting
  
  Fold-change heatmap coloring or peptide-type coloring

This tool was developed to explore large-scale proteome conformation datasets across aging, polyQ proteotoxicity, heat shock, myosin-ts, and paramyosin-ts models.
