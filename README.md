Protein Whisper — Interactive Proteome Conformation Explorer

Protein Whisper is an interactive Streamlit application for visualizing protein conformational changes, solubility, and total abundance using LiP–TMT–MS–based structural proteomics.
It integrates:

AlphaFold structural models

Peptide-level conformation metrics

Protein-level abundance (soluble / pellet / total)

Interactive 3D visualization with py3Dmol

Volcano plots for conformation changes

Dynamic peptide highlighting

Fold-change heatmap coloring or peptide-type coloring

This tool was developed to explore large-scale proteome conformation datasets across aging, polyQ proteotoxicity, heat shock, myosin-ts, and paramyosin-ts models.
